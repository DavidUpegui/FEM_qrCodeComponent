## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learn a lot about the flex system. Theorically I have the theory about css (flex) but I hadn't had the opportunity for apply it an this excersice was perfect for that.

### Continued development
The use of the classes in the project: when and where to use a class or just use de html tag?. Also, I think that the structure can be improved.

### Useful resources
- Basically Google search.
